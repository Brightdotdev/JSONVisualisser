## 🌱 Branch Naming Convention

Please name your branches in a way that reflects their purpose:

| -------- | -------------------------------- |
| Feature  | `feature/search-bar-improvement` |

## 🧩 Commit Message Guidelines

```

Prefix keywords:

* `fix:` → bug fix
* `docs:` → documentation update

3. Add screenshots or screen recordings if UI-related.
4. Run a quick local test before submitting:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
